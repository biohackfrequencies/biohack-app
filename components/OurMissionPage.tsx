                    <p>
                        Our story begins with our founder, a professional DJ and sound engineer whose world has revolved around sound for over 25 years. We've lived and breathed the profound impact frequency has on human emotion, learning how to shift moods and create entire experiences by controlling it. It was an art and a craft.

                <MissionSection title="The Pivot to Science">
                    <p>
                        But that curiosity went deeper. Seeing how sound could help overcome personal obstacles, we knew it was more than just a feelingâ€”it was science. This led us down a path from the studio to the laboratory, studying the real, measurable effects of specific frequencies. We made it our mission to bridge the gap between intuitive 'sound healing' and verifiable, data-driven bio-acoustics.
