                    <p>
                        We believe sound is more than music ‚Äî it is a key to unlocking human potential. Our mission is to provide scientifically-grounded tools that empower people to shift their frequency, transform their state of being, and live in greater alignment with their highest selves.

                <MissionSection title="The Story Behind the Frequencies">
                    <p>
                        Our journey began with our founder ‚Äî a DJ and sound engineer with over 25 years of experience shaping soundscapes for human emotion. What started as an art of creating moods and experiences through music became a deeper quest: understanding why sound moves us so profoundly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This curiosity led us beyond the studio and into the science of bio-acoustics. Through years of exploration, research, and experimentation, we discovered how specific frequencies resonate with body, mind, and spirit. What was once an intuitive practice revealed itself as a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern science.

                <MissionSection title="Our Vision">
                   <p>
                        We envision a world where sound becomes a daily tool for self-discovery, healing, and collective harmony. Where every person has the ability to tune themselves like an instrument ‚Äî to reduce stress, enhance focus, expand creativity, and raise consciousness.
